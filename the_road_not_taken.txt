Da Road Not Taken 
BY Bob "Too Good to Be Musubi" Frost

Author's Note: This poem is dedicated to the lovely lady at 7-11 from whereth I receive my daily sustenance -- you are my musubi muse. 

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as pear,
And having perhaps the better clam,
Because it was grassy and wanted weary;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black ice cream.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made difference.
